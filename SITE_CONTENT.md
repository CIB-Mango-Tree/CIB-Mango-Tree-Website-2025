## "See It In Action" Section

**Title:** See it in Action

**Left Column:**
> CIB Mango Tree makes social media bot detection simple for everyone. It begins with easy-to-run tests, the "low-hanging fruit," that help reveal clear signs of unsophisticated coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) in social media and online data.

**Right Column:**
> As you move up the Mango Tree, our tests become more advanced, helping experienced users tackle deeper, more complex cases of manipulation.

---

## "Tools for a Safer Internet" Section

**Title:** Tools for a safer internet

**Description:**
> CIB Mango Tree is a growing library of tools designed to detect signs of coordinated inauthentic behavior. It runs locally on your computer through an interactive command-line interface. Instead of scraping data, our programs analyze datasets of social media activity that you provide to identify abnormal online activity.

---

## Methodologies (Interactive Tabs)

**Section Title:** Methodologies

Each methodology appears as a clickable tab. Below is the content for each:

### Copy Pasta Test
> This test looks for repeated phrases—"copypasta"—that appears across posts in your dataset. Some coordinated campaigns may consist of bot accounts reposting the same phrases to cut down on time. Our test extracts these repeated phrases, and reveals which accounts posted them, and when, in order to reveal hidden networks.

### Hashtag Test
> The Hashtag Test analyzes hashtag usage patterns across your dataset to identify coordinated behavior. It detects unusual hashtag clustering, timing patterns, and account associations that may indicate inauthentic coordination. This helps reveal networks that use hashtags strategically to amplify messages.

### More Coming Soon!
> We are continuously developing new tools to help detect coordinated inauthentic behavior. Stay tuned for additional tests and features that will help you analyze social media datasets more effectively.
